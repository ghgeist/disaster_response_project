### To Do

- Understand how many of the original tweets are in English and how many of them are in Creole
- Understand how many of them have been translated
    - If they have been translated, how many times have they been translated?

### Housekeeping

- Add doc strings

### Ideas

- I think it would be cool to do a visualization so we can see how the tweets are clustering
- I think seeing the clusters over time would be especially useful
